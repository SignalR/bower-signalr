# ASP.NET SignalR JavaScript Client

**NOTE**: The Bower package for SignalR is now deprecated, since Bower itself is now deprecated. Please consider migrating to Yarn or NPM (as recommended [by the bower team](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/))

This is the client for ASP.NET SignalR. Use this package if you are connecting to an application written in ASP.NET (using System.Web, or OWIN self-host). This package is **not compatible** with ASP.NET **Core** SignalR. If you are connecting to an ASP.NET Core application, use the `@aspnet/signalr` package.
